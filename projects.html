								<h2 align="center"> Veto Detector for mini-ICAL</h2>
								<h1><i>A cosmic ray veto detector for veto-ing out triggers generated by charged particles from cosmic ray showers to enable neutrino interaction analysis with the mini-ICAL detector set-up on ground level</i></h1><br>

								The India-based Neutrino Observatory is a multi-institutional project to develop an underground observatory for non-accelarator based high energy and nuclear physics.
								The ICAL, or Iron Calorimeter detector is used for studying neutrinos. The mini-ICAL is a scaled down version of the ICAL detector. A research-phase proposal to establish the observatory on ground level instead of
								underground requires an efficient method to prevent charged particles from cosmic rays
								from reaching the ICAL detector. Hence, a veto detector engulfing the ICAL detector has been proposed. The application draws inspiration from the
								<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/361123/contributions/856188/attachments/1135881/1625309/DPF2015_CRV_Overview.pdf" target=" ">veto detector for Mu2E detector at Fermilab.</a><br>

								<p align="center"> <img src="images/projects/mical.png" style="width:40%"> <br>
									<i>The mini-ICAL detector</i>
								</p>

								I have been troubleshooting the CAEN DT5702 32-ch SiPM readout board which was supposed to be used for characterizing the detector setup. But, the module had to be sent back to CAEN for repairs and has a long turn-around.
								I decided to build my own SiPM readout board instead. TIFR plans to use this for science demonstration purposes as well. Hence, simple components (in terms of footprint, availability and cost) have been used.
								The schematics and PCB designs are now ready and we're waiting for the PCB to get manufactured in the foundry.

								<h2 align="center">Track reconstruction using deep neural networks</h2>
								Neutrinos and anti-neutrinos interact differently with atomic nuclei. Neutrino interaction produces leptons, whereas antineutrino interaction produces antileptons.
								The ICAL (Iron Calorimeter) at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) consists of stacked layers of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) between iron cores. These RPCs detect the particle generated by the interaction with the iron nuclei.
								Electromagnets are used to identify the charge of the emitted particle, its energy and momentum.<br>
								Currently, Kalman filters are used for the reconstruction of the track fit. My effort revolves around investigating the feasibility of implementing a Deep Neural Network based algorithm to reconstruct the tracks, and compare the efficiency with current methods.
								I'm solving this as a regression problem and trying to construct a suitable model using Keras as a development framework. Feel free to write to me with your inputs and insights on this problem.

										<h2>NASA Langley Research Center</h2><br><i>Worked Remotely for BATAL(Feb 2018 - May 2018)</i>
									</header>
								</section>
								<h1><i>Designed an airborne nitrogen-oxide (NOx) measurement payload </i></h1><br>

								Satellite observations have shown a recurrent aerosol layer, called the Asian Tropopause Aerosol Layer (ATAL). The ATAL was confirmed through solar occultation observations by Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment
								(SAGE) II. Analysis of long-term satellite measurements of UTLS (Upper Tropospheric Lower Stratospheric) aerosols suggests that ATAL’s aerosol optical depth has increased by 2-3 times since the late 1990’s pointing out its possible connection with Asian pollution growth. The presence of aerosol near the tropopause could impact the Earth’s radiative balance, and the properties of cirrus clouds. The ATAL appears to be a significant player in the Earth’s radiative budget of the Northern Hemisphere at decadal scale. Aerosol near the tropopause can potentially affect stratospheric ozone and also alter the properties of TTL (Tropical Tropopause Layer) cirrus clouds. To better understand the nature, formation, and impacts of the ATAL, a series of balloon field campaigns have been organized since 2014, called the BATAL project.<br>
								The payload has been designed to determine nitrate concentration levels in the UTLS regions of earth's atmosphere by being deployed on a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) flight. The reaction between nitrate and ozone releases photons in the near-IR spectrum. This phenomenon is called chemiluminescence. The intensity of the light emission is measured using an SiPM  to estimate the nitrate concentration. The payload is used to conduct an online analysis of the sample gas and transmit the data to the ground station over a telemetry channel.

								&emsp; <a href="http://projectapeiro.com" target=" ">Website</a> &emsp; <a href="https://www.facebook.com/projectapeiro/" target=" ">Facebook page</a> <br>

								<br><i>Technical Information:</i><br>
								1. The setup uses 3 detectors stacked vertically to obtain a coincidence trigger. <br>
								2. The detectors are constructed using Photomultiplier Tubes (PMT) coupled to plastic scintillator blocks using optical glue. <br>
								3. A hardware fast data acquisition system is designed to process the detector signals and measure the flux. <br>
								4. A highly regulated high voltage power supply system is designed to ramp up the battery voltage to the operational voltage of the PMTs (in kV range). <br>
								5. A temperature and pressure sensor, intertial measurement unit and GPS are used. <br>
								6. TI MSP432 based microcontroller is used. An EEPROM is used for data storage.<br>
								7. Experimental data is encoded and transmitted over S-band to the ground station.<br>
								8. The setup was passed through environmental chamber test, EMI test and long duration test.<br>
								9. Flight was conducted using a 3,000 m^3 volume zero pressure plastic balloon. <br>
								10. Two float altitudes achieved (first time in India): 24.8 km and 26.7 km.<br>


								<br><i>Background Information:</i><br>
								As a child, I always wanted to become an astronaut and go to space. When I started studying engineering, I realised I could build something that goes to space. Project Apeiro, was my strive to reach space.
								My University did not have any active student satellite program and starting a new mission seemed impractical due to several reasons. Firstly, I was a freshman with questionable knowledge about any sort of engineering.
								Moreoever, the typical duration for a student satellite mission seemed to extend beyond the duration of my engineering studies. Eventually, I started working on a near-space mission, which had similar challenges as a space
								mission, but seemed more pragmatic. The payload was decided to be a cosmic radiation flux measurement instrument. We used the facilities and expertise of the Dept. of High Energy Physics at TIFR Mumbai to develop the payload. Experts from the Astrosat group adviced
								us with making our payload flight-worthy. We designed, manufactured, integrated and tested the instrument for the flight.<br>
